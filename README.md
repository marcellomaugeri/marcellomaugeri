Hello, I'm Marcello, a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Catania.
I am passionate about automated security testing for software and systems, with a focus on developing tools and techniques to improve the automation of security testing processes.
My current research project focuses on improving coverage-guided fuzzing for multi-process Linux applications, with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of fuzz testing in identifying security vulnerabilities.
However, I am actively exploring other areas such as fuzzing IoT devices or fuzzing web applications, including the use of AI/ML techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fuzz testing.
I am driven by curiosity and a desire to learn, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of more automated security testing tools and techniques that can help organisations better protect their systems and data from security threats.
